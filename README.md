# Vectors

## Points, Vectors, Lines, Segments, Triangles
You can choose between five types of Inputs.
If for example you choose a **Line** it can be 
instanced with a **Point** and a **Point** or
with a **Point** and a **Vector**. For each class
there is an interactive menu which lists
all the available options which can be used
as of now. There are parametric equations,
normals, planes, line intersections and
a lot more. I might do updates on this little project in the future adding an interactive UI and new types of geometrical objects.
